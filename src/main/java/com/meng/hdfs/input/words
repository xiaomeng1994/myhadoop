Spark SQL is a Spark module for structured data processing
Unlike the basic Spark RDD API the interfaces provided by
Spark SQL provide Spark with more information about the
structure of both the data and the computation being performed
Internally Spark SQL uses this extra information to perform extra
optimizations There are several ways to interact with Spark SQL
including SQL and the Dataset API When computing a result the same
execution engine is used independent of which API language you are
using to express the computation This unification means that developers
can easily switch back and forth between different APIs based on which
provides the most natural way to express a given transformation
The Apache Hadoop software library is a framework that allows
for the distributed processing of large data sets across clusters
of computers using simple programming models. It is designed to scale
up from single servers to thousands of machines each offering local
computation and storage Rather than rely on hardware to deliver high-availability
the library itself is designed to detect and handle failures at the
application layer so delivering a highly-available service on top of a
cluster of computers each of which may be prone to failures
